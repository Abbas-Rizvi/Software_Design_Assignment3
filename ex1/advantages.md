The main advantage from this implementation of the cash Register program is the simplicity. It is very clear how the program is operating and what each component is doing within the model, controller and the view components.

The biggest disadvantage of this implementation is that it is very difficult to modify the code and to add new view and controllers. There is no standardised way to add these components so it could cause some difficulty later down the line.
